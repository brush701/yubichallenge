    <string name="info">This app provides a simple interface for using the NFC challenge-response functionality built into a Yubikey Neo. It will be started by a 3rd party app such as keepass2android when necessary. It is provided as a standalone app so that the majority of users who do not own a Yubikey do not have to grant NFC permissions unnecessarily.</string>
